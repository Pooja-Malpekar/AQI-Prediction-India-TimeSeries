# AQI Time Series Forecasting 📈🌫️

This repository contains a time series forecasting case study focused on predicting the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** using different models including ARIMA, SARIMA, and Facebook Prophet.

## 📊 Project Overview

With the increasing concern around air quality and its impact on public health, forecasting AQI can help in early warning systems and policy planning.

This project:
- Loads and preprocesses AQI data.
- Checks stationarity and transforms data accordingly.
- Applies three forecasting models:
  - ARIMA
  - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)
  - Facebook Prophet
- Compares model performance with visualizations and error metrics.
